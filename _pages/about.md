I am the master student of the School of Computer Science and Technology at Southwest University of Science and Technology, expected to graduate in 2021. During my master phase, I have researched the image inpainting, image segmentation, action recognization, face recognization, etc. I am familiar with the Linux system, python, PyTorch, NumPy, cv2, PIL, etc. I also used the TensorFlow, matlab, C++/C#. Currently, I am interested in Domain Generalization and Domain Adaption.
